    "Since this is the first milestone report there are no deliverable goals that were met or not met. The main deliverable goals to meet before the next milestone report is the code to be thirty-five percent complete, the presentation to be thirty percent complete, and the demo to be fifteen percent complete. Every team member is working to build a general-purpose convolution neural network. Matthew Ogden is working on the presentation and building a general-purpose regression model to compare two images. Aric Moilanen is working on the project paper. Derrick Reckers is working on the project demo. Shawn Mace is building a single layer network that can conveniently visualize weights. Jarrett Shaver is building code to conveniently train a new regression model on a new system of model images and human scores."

Shawn Mace, Matthew Ogden, Jarrett Shaver, and Devon Wilson are working to get the code base to eighty percent before the next milestone. Matthew Ogden will be building a neural network to feed in two images and compare them and doing analysis on how well our neural networks are doing. Shawn Mace will be building a single layer network that can visualize the weights and creating callback functions to save slices of the network.
