    "This project builds upon on-going research to model and simulate galaxy collisions within the Computational Science Ph.D. Program and Physics and Astronomy Departments here at Middle Tennessee State University. The data being used for our project will come from this reserach and Galaxy Zoo: Mergers.  Mergers is a citizen scientist effort to find models for sixty two target galaxy collisions with the use of SPAM, a simulation that recreates the tidal distortions or shape that galaxies undergo during collision.  Citizen scientists were presented with target images of two colliding galaxies and several simulations that attempt to model the target collision.  Using the innate human ability to visually recognize patterns, citizen scientists identified sixty-six thousand models that have resemblance to the target image.  Once selected, these galactic models also underwent a tournament-like scoring system to identify the best models for a particular target system, and give them corresponding human fitness scores for how well each individual model matched the target image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The human ability to process visual patterns and identify similarities is incredibly complex.  Trying to identify and measure the “similarity” between two images is often arbitrary and could depend on hundreds of different factors depending on the objects or images being compared.  Even with the increase of computer image processing and computational power, previous efforts to manually program and predict the similarity has had poor results this research.  We hope to utilize neural networks to capture the human ability to analyze patterns and predict similarities, at least in the narrowed application of galaxies. \n",

    "The focus of our project is to create a variety ***neural network regression models*** for predicting how well a model image “fits” a target image.  Our regression models will be trained on pre-existing ***model images*** and associated ***human fitness scores*** from Galaxy Zoo: Mergers.  The regression model will take galaxy images and produce a ***machine fitness score*** that attempts to predict human machine scores.  To evaluate the performance of our regression models, our primary metric will be the ***statistical correlation*** between machine fitness score and human fitness scores.  In addition to the correlation, graphs will be constructed to identify outliers and potential overfitting.  Once the regression models are built and operational, researchers could use new model images to create new machine scores, allowing a human user to agree or disagree with whether the machine score is appropriate for the image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to develop a neural network regression model for each individual target system with sixty two total systems.  Each target system can be trained on hundreds to thousands of model images and human scores.  In addition, a variety of neural network architectures will be implemented and analyzed.  Perhaps a particular architecture performs the best across the majority of target systems.  One goal of the research is to determine if there's enough data for all of the targets.  Some targets have little more data than others and have better-quality data.  If regression models can be made for most targets, but perform\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible application is to build a general-purpose neural network model that can predict the similarity between any two images of colliding galaxies.  This could be trained on a large sampling of images from all sixty two target systems above.  This may be difficult to build, as each system undoubtedly has variance in how their similarity scores scale.  For example, a 0.75 similarity for one system may resemble a much higher “similarity” between images than a 0.75 for another system which contains poorer quality models and data.  However, the flexibility of a general purpose regression model may be well worth the effort.  A general-purpose comparison could be applied to future galaxy collision systems and allow for direct comparisons between target systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another application could be to create single-layer networks for all of the target systems.  With these single-layer networks, the weights could be visualized and scientists could identify what sections of the image are most crucial for predicting a similarity score.  For example, do all the systems have a greater importance along tidal features or the edges of the galaxy shape?  Is pixel importance related to the distance between the axis between galaxy centers?  Which sections of the images can be mostly ignored? \n",
    "\n",
    "One ambitious idea is to incorporate existing open-source image classification models.  WNDCHRM is an open-source image classification software, that goes beyond the raw pixel intensities.  Instead WNDCHRM extracts hundreds of image features, identifies which image features best predicts an images classification, and uses those metrics to train and predict a classification model.  Perhaps WNDCHRM could be utilized for its automated feature extraction and identification, then use those image feature to build an even more accurate and robust neural network regression model.  Once implemented, scientists can analyze which extracted features have the greatest impact on predicting galactic patterns and similarity, allowing for further understanding beyond the neural network \"black box\" predicting patterns. \n",
