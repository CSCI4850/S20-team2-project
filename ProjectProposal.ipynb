    "The data sets identified have been amassed for Galaxy Zoo: Mergers (Link:https://mergers.galaxyzoo.org/). The target information is framed as two galaxies converge.  The first data set is called Target Info which is a text file containing the coordinates (in Right Ascension (RA - east and west longitudinal coordinates) and Declination (Dec - north and south latitudinal coordinates) for the center of each galaxy paring.  There is also a set of alternative names derived Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (Arp), General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars (NGC/IC), Uppsala General Catalogue (UGC), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and Two Micron ALl Sky Survey (2MASS).  These sets are collected into a Target SDSS file with contains the id of the objects as well as the de-reddened magnitudes of SDSS u, g, r, i and z bands.  Those bands are filtered observations based on ultraviolet (u), green (g), red (r), near-infrared (i), and infrared (z) filtration measurements.  Whenever possible, DR7 and DR8 (data release) values are included.  \n",
